# device-inventory-on-fhir

Here I attempt to develop a tool to transform entries in a hospital inventory into FHIR resources for a number of use cases. This idea first came to me as part of my work in Africa with Engineering World Health, though I was not familiar with FHIR at the time. Once I became better versed in FHIR, it all came together an made sense. And now I'm finally getting around to tinkering.

## Use cases
 1. Inventory management -- inventories are collected each year at the various EWH placement hospitals
 2. Scheduling preventative maintenance -- Biomedical Equipment technicians (BMETs) in low-resource settings likely don't have a system for this
 3. (As part of a larger data model) device-specific analytics
